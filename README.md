Analyze traffic accident data to identify patterns related to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Visualize accident hotspots and contributing factors.

Steps Involved:

1.Data Collection:

Gather traffic accident datasets that include information on accidents, road conditions, weather conditions, and timestamps.

2.Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Clean the data to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies. Convert categorical variables (e.g., weather and road conditions) into a suitable format for analysis.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Conduct EDA to identify trends and patterns. Analyze accident frequency by road conditions, weather types, and time of day to see how these factors influence accident occurrence.

4.Hotspot Identification:

Use geographic information systems (GIS) or visualization libraries to plot accident hotspots on a map, highlighting areas with high accident rates.

5.Visualization of Contributing Factors:

Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps) to illustrate the relationships between accidents and contributing factors like road conditions, weather, and time of day.

Outcome:

The project will reveal critical insights into traffic accident patterns, enabling stakeholders—such as transportation authorities and urban planners—to implement targeted interventions aimed at improving road safety and reducing accidents in high-risk areas.
